<!-- ## About Me -->
Hi, I'm Zhao Yang, a third-year PhD student at Renmin University of China, supervised by [Prof. Bing Su](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/bingsu). I received my Bachelor's degree from Sichuan University. My research interests focus on Large Language Models and Deep Generative Models, particularly their applications in sequence-based scientific data. Additionally, I work closely with [Dr. Chuan Cao](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/chuancao/) and [Dr. Yingce Xia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yinxia/).
