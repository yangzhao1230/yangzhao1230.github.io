Hi, I'm Zhao Yang, a third-year PhD student at Renmin University of China, supervised by [Prof. Bing Su](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/bingsu). I received my Bachelor's degree from Sichuan University. My research interests focus on Language Models and Deep Generative Models, with a particular emphasis on their applications in AI for Biology (AI4Bio) and sequence-based scientific data.

Recent Research Interests
- Developing sequence-based scientific foundation models to advance biological and scientific understanding.
- Integrating foundation models with biological data and prior knowledge to solve critical community-focused tasks, such as variant effect prediction (VEP).

## Publications

### Interpretable Enzyme Function Prediction via Residue-Level Detection  
**Zhao Yang**, Bing Su, Jiahao Chen, Ji-Rong Wen. *Preprint.*  
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05644) | ðŸ’» [Code](https://github.com/yangzhao1230/ProtDETR)  
**TL;DR**: This work introduces ProtDETR, a novel framework that reframes enzyme function prediction as an object detection problem by identifying active sites as "objects" to interpret enzyme functionality.
