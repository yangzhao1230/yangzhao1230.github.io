Hi, I'm Zhao Yang, a fourth-year PhD student at Renmin University of China, supervised by [Prof. Bing Su](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/bingsu). I also work closely with [Dr. Chuan Cao](http://bjzgca.edu.cn/teacher/7af51beaba764c4cbca0615ff5d5f52d). I received my Bachelor's degree from Sichuan University. My research interests focus on Language Models and Diffusion Models, with a particular emphasis on their applications in AI4Science

<!-- 
Recent Research Interests:
- Developing sequence-based scientific foundation models to advance biological and scientific understanding.
- Integrating foundation models with biological data and prior knowledge to solve critical community-focused tasks, such as variant effect prediction (VEP).

### SPACE: Your Genomic Profile Predictor is a Powerful DNA Foundation Model
**Zhao Yang**\*, Jiwei Zhu\*, Bing Su. *ICML 2025*, *ICLR 2025 AI4NA Workshop & MLGenX Workshop.*  
📄 [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01833)  
💻 [Code](https://github.com/ZhuJiwei111/space)  
**TL;DR**:  We leverage MoE to better model cross-species and cross-genomic profile information in genomic data and hence make sequence-to-function genomic models to be powerful DNA foundation models.

### Regulatory DNA Sequence Design with Reinforcement Learning  
**Zhao Yang**, Bing Su, Chuan Cao, Ji-Rong Wen. *ICLR 2025.*  
📄 [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07981)  
💻 [Code](https://github.com/yangzhao1230/TACO)  
**TL;DR**: We propose a reinforcement learning framework for designing regulatory DNA sequences using transcription factor binding site rewards.

### Interpretable Enzyme Function Prediction via Residue-Level Detection  
**Zhao Yang**, Bing Su, Jiahao Chen, Ji-Rong Wen. *Preprint, ICLR 2025 LMRL Workshop.*  
📄 [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05644)  
💻 [Code](https://github.com/yangzhao1230/ProtDETR)  
**TL;DR**: We propose ProtDETR, a novel framework that reframes enzyme function prediction as an object detection problem by identifying active sites as "objects" to interpret enzyme functionality.

### Synthesizing Long-Term Human Motions with Diffusion Models via Coherent Sampling  
**Zhao Yang**, Bing Su, Ji-Rong Wen. *ACM MM 2023.*  
📄 [Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3581783.3611887)  
💻 [Code](https://github.com/yangzhao1230/PCMDM)  
**TL;DR**: We propose a text-driven diffusion-based framework for synthesizing long-term human motions, achieving coherent and realistic sequences with novel sampling strategies.

### A Molecular Multimodal Foundation Model Associating Molecule Graphs with Natural Language  
Bing Su, Dazhao Du, **Zhao Yang**, Yujie Zhou, Jiangmeng Li, Anyi Rao, Hao Sun, Zhiwu Lu, Ji-Rong Wen. *Preprint.*  
📄 [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05481)  
💻 [Code](https://github.com/ddz16/MoMu)  
**TL;DR**: We propose MoMu, a foundation model associating molecular graphs with natural language, enabling multimodal understanding and applications in molecular science.
