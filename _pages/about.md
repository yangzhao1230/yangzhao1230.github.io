Hi, I'm Zhao Yang, a third-year PhD student at Renmin University of China, supervised by [Prof. Bing Su](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/bingsu). I received my Bachelor's degree from Sichuan University. My research interests focus on Language Models and Deep Generative Models, with a particular emphasis on their applications in AI for Biology (AI4Bio) and sequence-based scientific data.

Recent Research Interests:
- Developing sequence-based scientific foundation models to advance biological and scientific understanding.
- Integrating foundation models with biological data and prior knowledge to solve critical community-focused tasks, such as variant effect prediction (VEP).

### SPACE: Your Genomic Profile Predictor is a Powerful DNA Foundation Model
Jiwei Zhu\* , **Zhao Yang**\*, Bing Su. *ICLR 2025 AI4NA Workshop & MLGenX Workshop.*  
**TL;DR**:  We leverage MoE to better model cross-species and cross-genomic profile information in genomic data.

### Interpretable Enzyme Function Prediction via Residue-Level Detection  
**Zhao Yang**, Bing Su, Jiahao Chen, Ji-Rong Wen. *Preprint, ICLR 2025 LMRL Workshop.*  
ðŸ“„ [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05644)  
ðŸ’» [Code](https://github.com/yangzhao1230/ProtDETR)  
**TL;DR**: We propose ProtDETR, a novel framework that reframes enzyme function prediction as an object detection problem by identifying active sites as "objects" to interpret enzyme functionality.
